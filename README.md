## User Instructions 

We all know and love Pac-Man, but here are the basic.

-Player moves the yellow circle around the screen
using the up, down, left, and right arrow key.
-Player must avoid the other color circle aka ghost!
-If player eats the powerPellet (4) the ghost will turn blue for 5 second. The player can eat and remove the ghost from the game (under construction, indiviudal goal)
-To win the game the player must eat all the pellets before and not collide with the ghost. If you do... you lose. 

## Developer's Corner

It is my own opionion that Chris's video help you build a skeleton, but leaves you room to turn this into your own, once you develop a understanding. See some of the code block I found to be diffcult, but developed a deeper understanding using Chris video.
