### Pac-Man is a maze action video game. 

This project is an example that was built following a Youtube content creator, name Chris. This project allowed me to learn and demostrate the following topics:


1. Object Oriented Programming 
2. Collision Detection 
3. For loops 
4. Arrays 
5. HTML 5 Canvas


## Watch Chris's Youtube Video

## User Instructions 

We all know and love Pac-Man, but here are the basics.

- :yellow_circle: (the player) moves around the screen
using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
- :yellow_circle: must avoid the :ghost: aka other color circles!
- :yellow_circle:  can eat the PowerPellets (4) to scare the ghost for 5 seconds. :yellow_circle:  removes the :ghost:  when they eat them. (see the *show must continue* section for a challenge)
- To win the game the :yellow_circle: must eat all the pellets. But Beware of the :ghost:. If they catch :yellow_circle:, its GAME OVER... 

## Developer's Corner :notebook:    

Chris's video helps me build a skeleton that I now can expand upon. See some of the code blocks, below that I found to be difficult and fun!

## And the show must continue ... A test to myself and others 

- :pushpin: Use sprite to create characters and Pacman grid
- :pushpin: Have ghost respawn in a caged area
- :pushpin: Have ghost chase pacman 
- :pushpin: Ghost shows a scared face when blue (using sprite)
- :pushpin: Have a next level options 
- :pushpin: Have ghost velocity increase with each level 
- :pushpin: Have Pac-Man animation when the game over 
- :pushpin: Append high score
