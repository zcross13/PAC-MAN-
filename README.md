# **PAC-MAN**

## Pac-Man is a maze action video game. 

This project is an example that was built following along with a Youtube content creator, name Chris. This project help provide detailed explaintion on how to do the following: 


*Object Oriented Programming 
*Collision Detection 
*For loops 
*Arrays 
*HTML 5 Canvas

## User Instructions 

We all know and love Pac-Man, but here are the basic.

*Player moves the yellow circle around the screen
using the up, down, left, and right arrow key.
*Player must avoid the other color circle aka ghost!
*If player eats the powerPellet (4) the ghost will turn blue for 5 second. The player can eat and remove the ghost from the game (under construction, indiviudal goal)
*To win the game the player must eat all the pellets before and not collide with the ghost. If you do... you lose. 

## Developer's Corner

It is my own opionion that Chris's video help you build a

<!-- Introduction: 

Pac-Man is a maze action video game. This version of Pac-Man is built using HTML 5 Canvas, JavaScript and Casacading Style Sheet (CSS).

Project Setup:
    HTML 5 Canvas is a element within HTML. Once you create the element in HTML a canvas is create that we can draw on and manipulate the pieces within it. 
Technology used:
    canvas - set up canvas in window
    windows height and width methods to allow the canvas to fill the entire link of the windows. 
    .getContext('2d): method used to pass methods and functions to allow us to draw, only 2d images. 

Technology used:
//Build Rectangle 
    c.fillRect(x,y,width,height): method of canvas, allow us to create rectangle. Take in four properties x-axis; y-axis; width; and height.
    c.fillstyle: to change the color of our rectangle 

//Build Arc/Circle/ Pac-Man && Ghost
    c.arc(x,y,radius,startAngle, endAngle): x vaule, y vaule, radius, startAngle- at what angle do we want to draw the arc; endAngle how long do we want the arc to go one for.

//animation function 
    requestAnimationFrame(): create a loop for the function called in the parameters 
    c.clearRect(0,0,innerwidth, innerheight): clear canvas 
    math.random(): give us a random intergers between 0 and 1

//Map boundaries
    create a class call boundary 
        properties of a boundary include its position, width and height. 
        methods of a boundary includes... 
            draws()- draws the boundary  
    create a variable called Map to store mutiple arrays. Each array contains a string of symbols. 
    we then loop over each row(array) within the maps variable. within that loop we loops over each string. Each string that contains a symbol will be stored in the boundaries array. 
    create a array call boundaries to store our boundaries create from our Map forEach loop. Create a forEach loop to loop over the boundary array and run the draw method.  -->
