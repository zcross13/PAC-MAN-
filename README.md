# **PAC-MAN :yellow_circle:**



## Pac-Man is a maze action video game. :joystick:

This project is an example that was built following a Youtube content creator, name Chris. This project allowed me to further explore the following topics:


1. Object Oriented Programming 
2. Collision Detection 
3. For loops 
4. Arrays 
5. HTML 5 Canvas

## User Instructions 

We all know and love Pac-Man, but here are the basics.

- :yellow_circle: moves around the screen
using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
- :yellow_circle: must avoid the other :ghost:  aka other color circles!
- :yellow_circle:  can eat the PowerPellets (4) to scare the ghost for 5 seconds. :yellow_circle:  removes the :ghost:  when they eat them. (see 'show must continue for a challenge)
- To win the game the :yellow_circle: must eat all the pellets before and not collide with the ghost. If you do... you lose. 

## Developer's Corner :notebook:    

Chris's video helps me build a skeleton to expand on and taught me some new skills along the way. See some of the code blocks, below that I found to be difficult.
